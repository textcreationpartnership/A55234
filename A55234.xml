            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PANEGYRICK TO THE KING.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>GReat Sir, may all the World give you Content,</l>
               <l>And especially your Parliament;</l>
               <l>You I. account in state of Marriage are,</l>
               <l>The Wife's happy when you your self so rare.</l>
               <l>All things, says the Philosopher, most happy be,</l>
               <l>According to the rise of each degree:</l>
               <l>That being done, things then will run most even;</l>
               <l>And great men below, live as 'twere in Heaven:</l>
               <l>Kings are like Gods, and therefore what they do say</l>
               <l>Is like the Oracle, to make us brisk and gay.</l>
               <l>And who won't by so good a King be led,</l>
               <l>Wants Faith, and has Wind-mills in his Head.</l>
               <l>'Tis Read, we must not boast of to Morrow,</l>
               <l>For if we do, 'tis the way to Sorrow:</l>
               <l>Let Time bring with it, and from her Womb</l>
               <l>Let her yield Health's Daughter, or Sickness Son;</l>
               <l>Since he has told us as to the Succession,</l>
               <l>He won't make void by any great Concession:</l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50075:2"/>
               <l>For Fathers, Mothers, and great Brothers dear,</l>
               <l>Legerdemain Nature, and they vanquish fear:</l>
               <l>'Tis each ones Case, we prefer a Brother</l>
               <l>Before Strangers, or yet any other.</l>
               <l>And shall we desire the same thing from him,</l>
               <l>Our Good, our Merciful, and our Gracious King?</l>
               <l>Nothing so bad that possibly can again</l>
               <l>Touch the Anointed, and his Golden Train:</l>
               <l>None would, or has a Power or Heart to do,</l>
               <l>But the Damned Jesuite, and his Bloody Crew.</l>
               <l>Religion true, commands Obedience still</l>
               <l>To Kings, whether they are good, or whether ill,</l>
               <l>Since 'tis its Precepts, not to let fly</l>
               <l>Against Blest Christian Monarchy.</l>
               <l>For if that we do, in our own Nets we</l>
               <l>Shall be taken into Captivity,</l>
               <l>And carried to the dismal place of those,</l>
               <l>Where Joys flye off, and dismal sorrow grows.</l>
               <l>Let Prayers to Heaven therefore constant be</l>
               <l>For Kings, and all that are in Authority,</l>
               <l>For Parliaments, and also for Religion,</l>
               <l>Making Chaste and Loving like Turtle and Pidgeon,</l>
               <l>That Quiet, Honest, and eke Godly lives</l>
               <l>We may in Pleasure live with our kind Wives.</l>
               <l>And having by our duty done all we can,</l>
               <l>On we shall mount to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where we shall be Rewarded as the blest;</l>
               <l>And for ever shall take our joyful rest,</l>
               <l>As Christians, Loyalists, and that far and near,</l>
               <l>In the Ravisht Air above, beyond the Hemisphere.</l>
